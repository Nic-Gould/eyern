GOALS
A fun project to help me learn rust. The idea is to build YoloV5 (detection only) from scratch in rust. From scratch to me means standard library only.
I've used an image library to load the images as I don't consider loading images part of the scope anymore than I consider openCV part of YOLO.
The program will load and process a single image, outputting the results to a text file. 

NEXT STEPS
Once operational I hope to add support for reading from a MJPEG stream, and hopefully outpuuting bounding boxes onto the image. I also imagine I'll use external crates for these functions. 



Levels of difficulty in this project

10-Trying to figure out how to use existing tensor crates and modules for this project [failed]
10-Trying to *initialise* an array with pre-existing data [failed]
9-Reading abstracted python functions and pytorch documentation to figure out what the hell is happening in the Yolov5 model [success]
7-Exporting (python) and importing (rust) the data [success]
4-The  (general) ML principles   [success]
3-The Matrix math and functions [success]
